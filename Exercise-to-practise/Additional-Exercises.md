## Additional Exercises

### 2. File Handling
1. Write a program that reads a text file and counts the occurrence of each word in the file. Ignore case and punctuation. Output the results to a new text file in descending order of frequency.

### 3. Exception Handling
1. Implement a custom exception class `InvalidAgeError` and write a program that prompts the user for their age. Raise the custom exception if the age is negative or unrealistically high (e.g., greater than 150).

### 4. Modules and Packages
1. Create a Python package named `math_utils` with modules for basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and matrix operations. Write a script that uses this package to perform a series of mathematical computations.

### 5. Object-Oriented Programming
1. Design a class hierarchy for different types of vehicles (e.g., Car, Truck, Motorcycle). Each class should have attributes and methods relevant to the vehicle type. Implement methods for starting the vehicle, stopping it, and displaying its information.

### 6. Functional Programming
1. Use Python's `functools.reduce` to implement a function that computes the factorial of a number. Compare this with a traditional iterative and recursive approach in terms of performance and readability.

### 7. Decorators
1. Write a decorator `time_it` that measures the execution time of a function and prints the result. Use this decorator to time different sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort) on large lists.

### 8. Generators
1. Implement a generator function that yields prime numbers indefinitely. Write a program that uses this generator to print the first 100 prime numbers.

### 9. Context Managers
1. Write a custom context manager `open_file` that opens a file, ensures it is properly closed after operations, and handles exceptions that might occur during file operations.

### 10. Regular Expressions
1. Write a program that uses regular expressions to validate email addresses. The program should take a list of email addresses as input and print whether each email address is valid or not.

These exercises will help you deepen your understanding of advanced Python concepts and improve your problem-solving skills. Feel free to modify or expand upon these exercises as needed. Happy coding!
