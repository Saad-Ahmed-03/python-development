# Advanced Python Practice Exercises

## 1. Learn the Basics

### 1.1 Variables & Data Types
1. Implement a program that dynamically determines the type of a variable and performs type-specific operations. For example, if the variable is a string, reverse it; if it's a list, sort it; if it's a dictionary, print its keys.

### 1.2 Basic Operators
1. Create a calculator program that can take a mathematical expression as input (e.g., "3 + 5 * 2 / (7 - 3)") and evaluate it using Python's `eval()` function. Ensure the program handles invalid expressions gracefully.

### 1.3 String Formatting
1. Write a program that takes a template string with placeholders and a dictionary of values, and performs string formatting to replace the placeholders with the corresponding values from the dictionary.

### 1.4 Basic String Operations
1. Implement a function that takes a string and returns a dictionary with the frequency count of each character in the string. Ignore case and non-alphanumeric characters.

### 1.5 Conditions: Decision Making
1. Write a program that solves a quadratic equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. The program should take the coefficients (a, b, c) as input and output the real and/or complex roots.

### 1.6 Loops
1. Implement a program that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using both iterative and recursive approaches. Compare the performance of both methods for large values of `n`.

### 1.7 Functions
1. Write a higher-order function `apply_function` that takes a function and a list as arguments, and returns a new list with the function applied to each element of the original list. Test this with different functions (e.g., squaring each number, converting each string to uppercase).

### 1.8 Lists
1. Implement a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer and its frequency count in the original list. Use list comprehensions and dictionary operations.

### 1.9 Tuples
1. Write a program that takes a list of tuples representing points in 2D space (e.g., [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]) and returns the pair of points with the maximum Euclidean distance between them.

### 1.10 Dictionaries
1. Implement a program that merges two dictionaries. If a key exists in both dictionaries, the corresponding values should be added if they are numeric, or concatenated if they are strings.
