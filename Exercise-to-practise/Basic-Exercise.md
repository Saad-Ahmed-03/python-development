# Python Practice Exercises

## Learn the Basics

### 1 Variables & Data Types
1. Create variables of different data types (integer, float, string, boolean) and print their values and types.
2. Convert a float to an integer and a string to a float. Print the converted values and their types.

### 2 Basic Operators
1. Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers and print the results.
2. Use comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) to compare two numbers and print the results.
3. Use logical operators (and, or, not) to combine multiple conditions and print the results.

### 3 String Formatting
1. Create a string that includes your name and age using the `format()` method.
2. Use f-strings to create a string that includes your name, age, and favorite hobby.

### 4 Basic String Operations
1. Create a string and perform the following operations: find its length, convert it to uppercase, replace a substring with another substring.
2. Split a string into a list of words and then join the list back into a single string.

### 5 Conditions: Decision Making
1. Write a program that checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result.
2. Write a program that takes a score as input and prints the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, F).

### 6 Loops
1. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
2. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
3. Write a program that prints the elements of a list using a `for` loop.

### 7 Functions
1. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
2. Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the string reversed.
3. Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest number in the list.

### 8 Lists
1. Create a list of your favorite fruits and print the list.
2. Add a new fruit to the list, remove a fruit from the list, and print the updated list.
3. Sort the list of fruits in alphabetical order and print the sorted list.

### 9 Tuples
1. Create a tuple with your favorite colors and print the tuple.
2. Access and print the first and last elements of the tuple.
3. Try to modify an element in the tuple and observe the result (note: tuples are immutable).

### 10 Dictionaries
1. Create a dictionary with keys as the names of your friends and values as their favorite colors. Print the dictionary.
2. Add a new friend and their favorite color to the dictionary, and print the updated dictionary.
3. Remove a friend from the dictionary and print the updated dictionary.
4. Write a program to iterate through the dictionary and print each friend's name and their favorite color.
